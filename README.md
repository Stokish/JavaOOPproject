Coffee Bar APP!
We created Coffee Bar app for our endterm project. We used Builder Creational pattern and Swift library.
Here is what is what:
Coffee - Main product class,
CoffeeMaker - Interface for Builder,
Barista - Builder,
Order-Coffee - Director for the Builder,
Database - Class for connecting to database,
DBCoffee - class that extend Database and some functionality,
Ð¡offeeGUI - class that uses all files above,
Machine - class that runs the code.


Steps to run our code:
1. Create database called coffee_bar and use sql file from repository.
2. Add module .jar file to your project structure.
3. Change CoffeeGUI file on 44 line. Wirte there your username and password for Database.
4. Run code in machine/Machine file.

App may look ugly, unfortunately, this is unfixed at the moment
